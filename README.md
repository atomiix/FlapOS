# FlapOS

**FlapOS is an alternative firmware for [Flapit devices](https://flapit.com).**

The main features are:
- **Compatibility mode** (same as the original firmware but you can choose which server to connect to. See [Flapit-server](https://github.com/atomiix/Flapit-server))
- **Server mode** (you can contact the device directly on your network)
- **Access-Point mode** (you connect directly to the device)
